        <p id="bottom-box-text"> Lucky Lab Coffee Co. was born as a faint and floundering idea in Hawaii, built-in Charleston, SC and eventually, the little black truck opened its window in Austin, Texas. Our adorable coffee truck ran all over Austin sharing cups of craft coffee with thousands of wedding guests, at local events and festivals, dozens of corporate offices and so many loyal students on the University of Texas campus. An answer to an ‘in search of’ ad on a food truck site led us to a partnership with Urban Outfitters. At the time they were interviewing the top local mobile concepts to help round out their newly coined concept space on the edge of West Campus. Being so new to the industry, we said yes to everything and built an open-air trailer. We were the only concept that survived in the space and a year later UO approached us with an opportunity to open our flagship brick-and-mortar location right next door. As cliche as it sounds, we’ve never looked back and have now become the new home to many of the local West Campus students, pups, faculty, neighbors and those alike to our location for the past six years.We are a small coffee shop located in the heart of the University of Washington. We are dedicated to providing the best coffee for the most depressed students. We are open from 8am to 8pm every day. Come visit us! </p>
